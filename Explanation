Axioms -
    0 is the only number
    S(x) is the successor function
    1 = S(0)
    2 = S(S(0))
    3 = S(S(S(0)))
    etc...

1.  A + 0       -> A
2.  A + S(B)    -> S(A + B)
3.  A + B       <-> B + A

Prove: 1 + 1 = 2
or if we encode the numbers as 0s and successor functions...
Prove:
   S(0) + S(0) = S(S(0))
-> S(S(0) + 0)      via 2.
-> S(S(0))          via 1.
== 2
therefore 1 + 1 = 2
